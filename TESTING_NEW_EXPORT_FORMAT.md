## 📸 BEFORE & AFTER COMPARISON

### How to Compare:

1. **If you have old exports**, open them side-by-side with new ones
2. **Notice the differences:**
   - Old: Plain black text, no logo, smaller fonts
   - New: Colored headers, logo, larger fonts, better spacing

3. **Print both** (optional)
   - See how much more professional the new format looks on paper

---

## 🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING

### If Logo Doesn't Appear:

**Check:**
1. Is `logo.png` file in `LibraryApp/` folder?
2. Is the file readable (not corrupted)?
3. Check console for error messages

**Solution:**
- Ensure logo.png exists in the correct location
- If missing, headers will still work (just without logo)

### If Colors Don't Show:

**Check:**
1. Are you opening in Excel 2010+ or Word 2010+?
2. Is color display enabled in your application?

**Solution:**
- Update to newer Office version
- Try opening in LibreOffice (also supports colors)

### If Merged Cells Look Wrong:

**Check:**
1. Number of data columns
2. Excel version compatibility

**Solution:**
- The code automatically adjusts for column count
- Ensure using xlsx format (not xls)
