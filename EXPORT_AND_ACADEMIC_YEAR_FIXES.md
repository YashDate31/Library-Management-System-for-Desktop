# Export & Academic Year Fixes - October 3, 2025

## 🎯 Issues Fixed

---

## ✅ Issue 1: Export Records Error Fixed

### Problem:
```
Error: Failed to export records: 9 columns passed, passed data had 10 columns
```

### Root Cause:
- The `get_all_records()` function returns 10 columns (including academic_year)
- The records tree displays only 9 columns
- Export function was expecting exactly 9 columns but receiving 10

### Solution:
Updated `export_records_to_excel()` function to:
1. Convert values tuple to list
2. Trim to exactly 9 columns if more than 9
3. Pad with empty strings if less than 9
4. Ensures DataFrame always has exactly 9 columns

### Code Change:
```python
# Before (caused error):
visible_records.append(vals)

# After (fixed):
record_list = list(vals)
if len(record_list) > 9:
    record_list = record_list[:9]  # Trim extras
elif len(record_list) < 9:
    record_list.extend([''] * (9 - len(record_list)))  # Pad if needed
visible_records.append(tuple(record_list))
```

### Result:
✅ Export now works correctly  
✅ No column mismatch errors  
✅ Excel file generates successfully

## 💡 Pro Tips

```
Records Tab → Academic Year dropdown
Select specific year to see that year's activities
Example: Select 2024-2025 to see last year's records
```

```
Apply filters (Year, Type, Date) → Click Export
