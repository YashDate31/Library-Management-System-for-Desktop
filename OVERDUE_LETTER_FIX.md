# Overdue Letter Feature - Bug Fixes

## 🐛 Issues Fixed - October 3, 2025

## Issue 1: ❌ Overdue Letter Not Working

### Problem:
When double-clicking on overdue records, it was showing "Not Overdue" message even though the fine was greater than 0.

### Root Cause:
The code was checking if `'(Late)'` text exists in the fine field, but the logic was incorrect.

### Solution:
Changed the detection logic to:
1. Extract the numeric fine amount from the display text
2. Remove "Rs" and "(Late)" text to get the number
3. Check if fine > 0 AND status = 'borrowed'

### Code Change:
```python
# OLD (WRONG):
if status.lower() == 'borrowed' and '(Late)' in fine_info:

# NEW (CORRECT):
fine_amount = 0
try:
    fine_str = fine_info.replace('Rs', '').replace('(Late)', '').strip()
    fine_amount = int(fine_str)
except:
    fine_amount = 0

if status.lower() == 'borrowed' and fine_amount > 0:
```

### Result:
✅ Now correctly identifies overdue records
✅ Letter generation works for all overdue students
✅ Shows proper error for non-overdue records

## Issue 2: 💰 Missing "Rs" in Fine Column

### Problem:
Fine amounts were showing as plain numbers (e.g., "125 (Late)", "70 (Late)")
User wanted "Rs" prefix before amounts.

### Solution:
Modified `populate_records_tree()` function to add "Rs" prefix:
- Overdue records: `Rs 125 (Late)`
- Non-overdue records: `Rs 0`

### Code Change:
```python
# OLD:
fine_display = f"{fine_val_num} (Late)" if fine_val_num > 0 else str(fine_val_num)

# NEW:
if fine_is_num and isinstance(fine_val_num, int) and fine_val_num > 0:
    fine_display = f"Rs {fine_val_num} (Late)"
else:
    fine_display = f"Rs {fine_val_num}" if fine_is_num else str(fine_val_num)
```

### Result:
✅ All fine amounts now show with "Rs" prefix
✅ Overdue records: "Rs 125 (Late)"
✅ Non-overdue records: "Rs 0"
✅ Better clarity for users
