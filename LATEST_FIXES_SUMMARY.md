# Latest Fixes & Improvements Summary

## ðŸŽ¯ All Issues Fixed - October 3, 2025

## âœ… Issue 1: Type Filter Not Working Properly

### Problem:
- "Overdue" filter was not working correctly
- "Issued" and "Returned" filters were not filtering properly

### Solution:
- Fixed filter logic in `search_records()` function
- **Overdue**: Now correctly filters records with fine > 0
- **Issued**: Filters records with status = 'borrowed'
- **Returned**: Filters records with status = 'returned'

### Code Change:
```python
# Now properly checks each filter type
if type_filter == "Overdue":
    if fine_val == 0 or fine_val == '0':
        continue
elif type_filter == "Issued":
    if status_val.lower() != 'borrowed':
        continue
elif type_filter == "Returned":
    if status_val.lower() != 'returned':
        continue
```

## âœ… Issue 2: Book ID Auto-Generate Showing in Total Copies

### Problem:
- When clicking "Auto-generate Book ID", the Book ID was appearing in Total Copies field
- Entry variables were being reused causing wrong field updates

### Solution:
- Created separate variable `book_id_entry` for Book ID field
- Removed duplicate grid() calls
- Fixed entry variable assignment
- Added numeric validation for Total Copies field

### Code Change:
```python
# Separate variable for Book ID entry
book_id_entry = tk.Entry(...)
entry = book_id_entry  # Store the actual entry widget

# Total Copies with numeric validation
if field_name == "copies":
    entry.insert(0, "1")
    entry.config(validate='key', validatecommand=...)
```

## âœ… Issue 3: Book ID Format Changed to Numbers (1, 2, 3...)

### Problem:
- Book IDs were BK001, BK002, BK003...
- Teacher wanted simple numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4...

### Solution:
- Rewrote `get_next_book_id()` function in database.py
- Now generates smallest available number starting from 1
- If books exist with IDs 1, 2, 4, 5 â†’ next ID will be 3 (fills gaps)
- If books exist with IDs 1, 2, 3 â†’ next ID will be 4

### Code Change:
```python
def get_next_book_id(self):
    # Get all existing numeric Book IDs
    # Find smallest available number
    # Fill gaps if any, otherwise increment
    return str(smallest_available_number)
```

---

## âœ… Issue 4: Book ID Uniqueness Check

### Problem:
- No validation to prevent duplicate Book IDs
- Could add books with same ID causing database errors

### Solution:
- Added database query before saving book
- Checks if Book ID already exists
- Shows error message with Book ID if duplicate found

### Code Change:
```python
# Check Book ID uniqueness before saving
conn = self.db.get_connection()
cur.execute('SELECT COUNT(*) FROM books WHERE book_id = ?', (book_id_val,))
if exists:
    messagebox.showerror("Error", f"Book ID '{book_id_val}' already exists!")
    return
```

## âœ… Issue 5: Undo Last Should Undo ALL Students

### Problem:
- "Undo Last" was only undoing ONE student
- Teacher wanted to undo entire promotion batch

### Solution:
- Rewrote `undo_last_promotion()` in database.py
- Now finds the most recent promotion timestamp
- Gets ALL students promoted in that batch (same timestamp)
- Reverts ALL of them to their previous year
- Deletes ALL promotion records from that batch

### Code Change:
```python
def undo_last_promotion(self):
    # Get most recent promotion timestamp
    # Get ALL records with that timestamp
    # Revert ALL students from that batch
    # Delete ALL records from that batch
    return True, f"Undone promotion for {count} student(s)"
```

## âœ… Issue 6: Simplified Promotion History

### Problem:
- History showed detailed individual student records
- Too much information, hard to read
- Teacher wanted summary: Letter Number, Date, Time, Count

### Solution:
- Rewrote `show_promotion_history_dialog()` function
- Groups records by promotion timestamp and letter number
- Shows summary columns:
  - Letter Number
  - Date
  - Time
  - 1stâ†’2nd (count)
  - 2ndâ†’3rd (count)
  - 3rdâ†’Pass Out (count)
  - Total Students

### New Columns:
| Letter Number | Date | Time | 1stâ†’2nd | 2ndâ†’3rd | 3rdâ†’Pass Out | Total Students |
|--------------|------|------|---------|---------|--------------|----------------|
| PROMO-2025-1 | 2025-10-03 | 14:30:25 | 5 | 8 | 3 | 16 |
