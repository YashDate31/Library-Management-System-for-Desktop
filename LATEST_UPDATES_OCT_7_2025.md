## 🐛 CRITICAL BUG FIX: Overdue Detection

### Problem:
- Overdue students were not being detected correctly
- Error message showed "There are currently no overdue issued books" even when overdue books existed
- Function was expecting 9 fields but `get_all_records()` returns 10 fields (with academic_year)

### Solution:
Updated `get_current_overdue_records()` function to:
- Handle 10-field records correctly (including academic_year field)
- Use only the first 9 fields for overdue processing
- Added better error handling and logging
- Fixed tuple unpacking issue

### Result:
✅ Overdue detection now works correctly
✅ Double-click on overdue records works
✅ Overdue letter generation functions properly

## 📝 TECHNICAL DETAILS

### Overdue Fix:
```python
# Old code (causing error):
enroll, name, book_id, title, borrow_date, due_date, return_date, status, fine = rec

# New code (handles 10 fields):
if len(rec) >= 9:
    enroll, name, book_id, title, borrow_date, due_date, return_date, status, fine = rec[:9]
    # 10th field is academic_year (ignored for overdue logic)
```

### Auto-Adjust Function:
```python
def _auto_adjust_column_width(self, worksheet):
    for column in worksheet.columns:
        max_length = 0
        for cell in column:
            if cell.value:
                cell_length = len(str(cell.value))
                max_length = max(max_length, cell_length)
        
        adjusted_width = min(max_length + 2, 50)
        worksheet.column_dimensions[column_letter].width = adjusted_width
```

### Least Popular Books Query:
```sql
SELECT 
    b.title,
    COALESCE(COUNT(br.id), 0) as borrow_count
FROM books b
LEFT JOIN borrow_records br ON b.book_id = br.book_id 
    AND br.borrow_date >= ?
GROUP BY b.book_id, b.title
ORDER BY borrow_count ASC, b.title
LIMIT 10
```

Key points:
- Uses `LEFT JOIN` to include books with zero borrows
- `COALESCE` ensures 0 count for never-borrowed books
- Orders by count ascending (least popular first)
- Secondary sort by title for consistent display

## 📊 SQL LOGIC FOR LEAST POPULAR

The key to identifying least popular books is using a `LEFT JOIN` instead of `INNER JOIN`:

**INNER JOIN** (old):
- Only returns books that have been borrowed
- Misses books with zero borrows
- Can't identify truly unused books

**LEFT JOIN** (new):
- Returns ALL books
- Shows 0 count for never-borrowed books
- Identifies unused inventory
- Perfect for demand analysis
