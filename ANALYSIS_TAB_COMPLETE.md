🎉 ANALYSIS TAB IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE! 🎉
====================================================

✅ PROBLEM SOLVED: The "Analysis Features Unavailable" message has been fixed!

🔧 WHAT WAS THE ISSUE:
- PyInstaller wasn't properly including matplotlib and xlsxwriter in the executable
- The packages needed to be installed in the correct virtual environment
- Hidden imports needed to be added to the build specification

🛠️ SOLUTION APPLIED:
1. ✅ Properly installed matplotlib and xlsxwriter in the virtual environment
2. ✅ Updated build_app.spec to include all matplotlib dependencies
3. ✅ Added hidden imports: matplotlib, matplotlib.pyplot, matplotlib.backends.backend_tkagg, numpy, xlsxwriter
4. ✅ Rebuilt executable with proper matplotlib integration (detected TkAgg backend)
