## 💡 Key Points

### 1. AUTOMATIC
You don't manually create academic years. The system does it when you promote students.

### 2. SUGGESTED
The system suggests the next year based on current date:
- October 2025 → Suggests 2026-2027
- July 2026 → Suggests 2026-2027
- October 2026 → Suggests 2027-2028

**Academic Year: July to June**

### 3. CUSTOMIZABLE
You can change the suggested year if needed:
- Default: 2026-2027
- You can type: 2027-2028 or any year

### 4. ONE ACTIVE YEAR
Only ONE academic year is active at a time. All new book issues use the active year.

### 5. HISTORICAL DATA PRESERVED
Old academic years remain in database. You can filter and view old records anytime.
