# 🔧 FIXED: Save Button Issue Resolved!

## What Was Wrong?
The "Save" and "Cancel" buttons in the Add Student and Add Book dialogs were not visible because:
1. The dialog window was too small (300x400)
2. The buttons were positioned outside the visible area

## ✅ What I Fixed:
1. **Increased dialog size**: 
   - Student dialog: 450x400 pixels
   - Book dialog: 450x450 pixels
2. **Improved button positioning**: Added proper spacing and made buttons larger
3. **Added icons**: 💾 Save and ❌ Cancel for better visibility
4. **Centered dialogs**: Automatically centers on screen

## 🚀 How to Use the Fixed Version:

### Option 1: Use the Updated Executable
1. **Close any running instances** of the app
2. **Navigate to**: `C:\Users\Yash\OneDrive\Desktop\Library Management System\LibraryApp\dist\`
3. **Run**: `LibraryManagementSystem.exe` (this is the latest fixed version)

### Option 2: Rebuild (if needed)
1. Open PowerShell in the LibraryApp folder
2. Run: `& "C:/Users/Yash/OneDrive/Desktop/Library Management System/.venv/Scripts/python.exe" -m PyInstaller "C:/Users/Yash/OneDrive/Desktop/Library Management System/LibraryApp/build_app.spec" --clean`
3. Use the newly built executable from `LibraryApp\dist\`
