feat: Mobile Interface Integration & Desktop Upgrade

This major update introduces a fully functional mobile web interface for students and integrates server controls into the existing desktop application.

1. Backend API Development
- Implemented a lightweight Flask server (`api.py`) for local intranet access.
- Added endpoints: `/api/login`, `/api/dashboard`, `/api/history`, `/api/catalog`.
- Enabled `PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL` in `database.py` for concurrent read/write access.
- Fixed ZeroDivisionError in Analysis charts for empty databases.

2. Mobile Frontend Interface
- Designed a "Premium" Glassmorphism UI (`mobile_web/`) ensuring a high-end user experience.
- Features: Student Dashboard, Book Search (Catalog), Borrowing History.
- Responsive design optimized for mobile devices.

3. Desktop Application Integration
- Updated `main.py` with a new "Dashboard" tab containing Server Controls.
- Added "Start/Stop Server" functionality using background subprocesses.
- Integrated `qrcode` generation to display a scannable link for students (`http://<IP>:5000`).
- Implemented automatic server cleanup on application exit.

4. Infrastructure & Deployment
- Added `populate_dummy_data.py` for generating test data (25 Students, 15 Books).
- Updated `requirements.txt` with `flask`, `flask-cors`, `qrcode`.
- Created detailed documentation (`MOBILE_INTEGRATION_REPORT.md`) in the project root.

This update maintains full backward compatibility with the existing Windows 7 offline environment while enabling modern mobile access.
